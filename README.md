### Topic: Finding the best place to open an Indian Restaurant in London 

##### Description of the Problem:
The idea of this study is to help people planning to open a new Indian restaurant in London to chose the right location by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on the same regions.  One of the big concerns for any Entrepreneur is the competition that already present in the market. So, he has to study the market to finalize the location where he intended to open a new business. Therefore in this project, I intend to explore different neighborhoods of London and find the best area to build a new Indian Restaurant in London to solve this persistent problem and to find a new business opportunity.This research is expected to benefit the entrepreneurs looking for a profitable location for opening a business (Indian Restaurant in this project) in London.
